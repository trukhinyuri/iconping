Small macOS menubar application that continuously pings the google-public-dns-a.google.com address checking if the connection is working, and changing the menubar icon accordingly.

The world icon will change color accordingly to the state of the connection:
– Grey if we receive pong packets back from google-public-dns-a.google.com. Connection OK.
– Yellow if we receive pong packets, but with a delay that is greater than 300 milliseconds. Connection Slow.
– Red if we don't receive pong packets for three seconds or more. Connection not working.

The application almost has no user interface at all, if not for a tiny menu used to quit the application.

Set it to automatically restart at the next reboot: Click Apple logo in menu bar -> System preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items -> + and add this applications to autostart.

Changes:
– Updated App Icon
– Updated Graphics
– Updated Business Logic
– App Sandbox Enabled
– Removed deprecated code for Autostart (add app to login item for that)
– Moving to XCode 8 project
– Set build target to 10.12
– Publishing to Mac App Store
